###About the GPD System

The GPD system is meant for people who spend a great deal of time text editing. It is a Todo app with the power of GTD and Mark Forster's Final Version with ninjitsu shortcuts for maximum workflow speed. Except for Section headers every line is a todo item. Special symbols allow you to understand different aspects of the todo item. Using combinations of regular and symbolic text, everything is free form text.  

###Pre-Requisites

To install GPD, you first need to install the Atom text editor. Go to the following link to download, http://atom.io/.

###Install Method
Will Bond has made a great plugin that loads packages into Sublime Text. If you use this method you will automatically get updates of GPD when they are released. I highly recommend using this approach.

1. Start Atom
2. Press `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux) or `command+shift+p` (Mac) and type Install Package. You should see "Settings View: Install Package".
3. In the search box, type "GPD" and press enter.
4. Find the GPD package and click the install button.

###Getting started
A few steps and you will be on your way.

1. Create new file and give it the extension `.GPD` and open it in Atom.
2. Type `///,Tab`. It will instantly give you the section layouts and put your cursor in the `Todo` section.
3. Create some Todos. Use symbols to note various aspects of the Todo. For all the symbols available (#, !, @, $, ~, \`) you can type `symbol,Tab` to enter them. All of the symbols represent different attributes of the todo:
	* `#,Tab` --> #(Project) - The project or group of work that this todo is part of.
	* `!,Tab` --> !(Target) - A measurable target for the todo. For example, a date, a specific performance metric, etc.
	* `@,Tab` --> @(Context) - People, places, or things that are related or required for the Todo. Such as a meeting room, a person whom you are waiting for or may need to call.
	* `$,Tab` --> $(Cost) - The amount of time or other cost metric that should be accounted for this todo.
	* `~,Tab` --> ~(Completion Date) - The date that you finished the todo.
	* ```,Tab`` --> `(Note ID) - An ID that references the Note attached to this todo
4. Once you got this under control, you will want to get familiar with the shortucts.

###Shortcuts
Shortcuts make GPD what it is, if you don't learn them it's not really going to work that well.

* `ctrl+?` - Create a new Todo at the bottom of the //Todo// section
* `ctrl+.` - Move the currently selected Todo at the top of the //Today// section
* `ctrl+}` - Move the current todo at the top of //Closed// section and put a ~(datetime.now) at the front of the todo
* `ctrl+{` - Do the same as `ctrl+}` except it will also copy the todo to the bottom of the //Todo// section
* `ctrl+,` - Get the note for this todo. It will either find or create the note for you in a companion `.GPD_Note` file. When in the GPD_Note file, you can press this again to switch back the main GPD file.

Note: In previous versions I used `âŒ˜` for mac. Now all commands are using `ctrl`.

###Sections7

Todos are divided into different sections. Today, Goals, and Closed. These sections are noted by `//Section Name//` followed by an `//End//`. The Today, Todo, and Closed sections are mandatory for this Sublime Text package. You can create any other sections you want.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
